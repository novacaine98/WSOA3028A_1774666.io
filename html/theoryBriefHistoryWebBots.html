                <p>“An internet bot is a software application that performs automated tasks by running 
                    scripts over the internet.” (Knecht, 2020)</p>
                <p>Bots perform simple structurally repetitive tasks at a far greater speed than humans 
                    could ever achieve. For the most part, these bots are harmless and are, in fact, crucial 
                    for making the internet as valuable and useful as it is. However, like most things that 
                    exist on the internet, they can become destructive and malignant when used by criminals 
                    or people who have bad intentions</p>
                <p>The oldest internet bot traces back to 1988 with the rise of internet chat relay also known 
                    as IRC. Some of the first bots used in IRC were Jyrki Alakuijala’s Puppe, Greg Linghal’s 
                    Game Manager (Hunt the Wumpus Game) and Bill Wisner’s Bartender. The bots used on IRC at 
                    the time, provided automated services to users and sat in the channel’s to make sure that 
                    the servers didn’t close it down because it was inactive. </p>
                <p>Other bots in the earlier history of the internet were web crawlers that were used for the 
                    first search engines. The first bot that was used to index webpages was WebCrawler and this 
                    was in 1994. The most famous web crawler, known today as the Googlebot, was originally called 
                    BackRub when it was created in 1996.</p>
                <p>Some of the earliest botnet programs were Sub7 and Pretty Park, a Trojan and worm. They were 
                    released into the IRC network in 1999, Their purpose or their function was to install themselves 
                    onto the users machine when they connected to an IRC channel so they could listen for malicious 
                    commands.</p>
                <p>GTbot was a fake mIRC client that emerged in IRC in 2000. It was capable of some of the first 
                    denial of service attacks. In the years that followed, botnet creators were able to use the 
                    machine infected from this to enact various attacks ranging from ransomware to identity theft 
                    and so on. After a while, botnets left IRC and began communicating through HTTP, SSL and ICMP.</p>
                <p>The prevalence of botnets has grown since then and still continues to. However, as important as 
                    they’ve become, they have also become a great tool to hackers. In 2007, one of the biggest botnets, 
                    Storm, infected up to 50 million computers, all of which were then used to commit a multitude of 
                    crimes including stock price fraud and identity theft. Botnets also played a significant role in 
                    the spam email epidemic in 2009, in which a botnet program called Cutwail was used to send 74 
                    billion spam emails a day. </p>
                <p>Today, bots are an important component to the construction of the internet that we experience today. 
                    Web crawlers allow for most the useful information to be found quicker amidst the millions of possible 
                    results. Chat bots have are a vital component for the operation of chat rooms and dialog windows and 
                    have evolved to the point of being able to fool humans, like the Cleverbot. Bots are essential to the 
                    working of the internet and while this is something that is considered essential, they, in hands of 
                    people with ill intentions, could also be destructive.</p>
