                    <p >
                        Accessibility refers to the practice of being able to have a website used by as many people as possible. This means having it 
                        be easy to access and navigate by people with disabilities, people who can only access certain types of devices, people with 
                        limited access to the internet or those with poor network connections. </p>
                    <p >
                        Designing a website with the intention of increasing accessibility and having it be able to be accessible to as many people 
                        as possible should always be at the forefront of your mind. It shows that you have good ethics and morals. It benefits more 
                        than it hinders and that is the most important thing. </p>
                    <p >
                        When trying to practice accessibility it is important to do research into the user experiences of those you are trying to 
                        cater for. It is not going to work if you work solely from your own perspective as a user without taking into account the 
                        challenges that others face when trying to access not only your website but the content on the internet in general. An 
                        understanding of the types of disabilities you are trying to cater for is important as well as what socio-economic barriers 
                        in terms of access you are trying to combat.</p>
                    <p >
                        The types of disabilities that you are trying to cater for will need different things. For example, for visually-impaired 
                        people, it is important to know that visual-impairments lie on a spectrum and that people who are impacted by this will 
                        have varying degrees of sight and provisions for this need to be made, whether it be having zooming functionality on your 
                        website or having text-to-speech functionality</p>
