                <p>For the external dependency/framework that we were supposed to implement in this iteration of the website, I chose to use the Responsive Grid System by Graham Miller. I was not entirely sure whether this counted as a framework or not but I decided to use this one because the purpose of it is to aid with responsive design and because it was simple to implement.</p>
<p>I used this framework on the home page as a test and in an effort to understand how it works and whether I could implement it in a way that would not completely change everything I had done up until that point. I used this one or I tried to use this one because it was meant to be easier to understand. I am still not entirely sure if this is something that meets the requirements and I am not sure that I did try to use it correctly or understand how to use it properly but I did also end up leaving framework empty in the homepage. </p>
<p>In terms of whether or not the dependency was necessary, I think that it was. It serves a valuable purpose in terms of the styling and the structuring of the website as well as the responsiveness of the website. I struggled with grappling responsiveness and seeing the framework and being able to go through it, made it simpler in terms of understanding. </p>
<p>In terms of alternatives to the type of framework that was used on this site, there were a few others that were also available that also focused on using grids to create responsive design. One of them was the Mueller Grid System which is a modular grid system for responsive and adaptive layouts and that is based on Compass. Another alternative is Columnal which is a CSS grid systems that is a mash-up of others like it with some custom code in as well. The elastic system is borrowed from the cssgrid.net and some code inspiration was taken from 960.gs.</p>
