                    The memex can be thought of as one of the earlier explanations of what would come to be hyperlinks in todayâ€™s day and age. Vannevar Bush described the memex as
                    a device where people would essentially create trails connecting information that others can follow and share with others. A library of sorts. It was said that 
                    the device would work or be designed or would mimic the associative properties of the human brain but, unlike the brain, the information would be processed and 
                    stored permanently. </p>
                <p>
                    Vannevar Bush talks about associative trails. These associative trails are ways in which linear sequences of information could be created with the use of microfilms 
                    as well as personal comments and annotations that are called side trails. Bush wanted to design the memex in a way that would make retrieving and storing data simple 
                    and efficient and worked in a similar way to the human brain. In this sense, he wanted to have it be so that information could be stored easily and be accessed by 
                    using certain cues to trigger the recollection of the information. In the case of the memex, it would be someone using a series of numbers in the form of a code as a 
                    means of accessing the information.</p>
                <p >
                    The memex has been credited as being the inspiration for the first practical hypertext systems. Although the ways in which the memex system functions and the way that 
                    the hyperlinks works are fundamentally different, the concept remains similar. The memex device would work by using microfilm storage, dry photography and analogue
                    computing and would work to connect trails of links connecting sequences of microfilm frames with the information whereas hyperlinks work to create links connecting 
                    single words, phrases or images in a document and a local or remote destination. 
                    An important factor that should not go unmentioned is the fact that the intention of the memex was for information to be shared, whether it was published works or 
                    personal annotations and comments.</p>
