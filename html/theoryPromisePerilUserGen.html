                <p >
                    It would seem, now more than ever, that user-generated content has become the very heart of the internet. It exists in almost every possible corner of the internet.
                    It lies in the comment and review sections, in the forums and blogs, in art, in curated feeds and so on. It opened the door for providing everyone with access to the 
                    internet, a means to communicate and share and build communities and engage with content. </p>
                <p >
                    In its early days, it was a very idealistic concept. The reality of open forums and communication channels where anything and everything could be posted and shared, 
                    where community guidelines and rules could be skirted and where loopholes could be exploited the extent where no one can be held accountable for the things they say
                    and do. Malicious content and hate speech are allowed to roam freely on the internet with very little consequence. </p>
                <p >
                    User-generated content, or at least a majority of the information on it, discusses how it is used in the commercial space. They speak about how user-generated content 
                    helps with sales and marketing of products and services and how having spaces where user-generated content can be created (blogs, social media, etc.) could help with 
                    the image of a brand and the business by helping build a reputation among internet users. Relying on user-generated content of your product or service acts as 
                    something of a doubt edged sword in the sense that a company could build a very positive reputation among users but should anything happen, and should the company make 
                    a mistake or should someone from the company do something anything that could jeopardise the company, news of that would spread like wildfire across the internet. </p>
                <p>
                    User-generated content, with all the potential good that it can do for the individual as well as companies and businesses, can also open the door for possible content
                    abuse. For the most part, a large part of the types of abuse that could arise is fraud-related. The stealing of identities, phishing, content theft and plagiarism.</p>
                <p >
                    While there does seem like there’s always more negatives than positives to speak about, user-generated content does have some redeeming qualities. Apart from 
                    communicating online with others, it also provides a space for people to share news and to learn about what is going on in the world around them. It creates 
                    opportunities for citizen journalism and offers a space for people to receive information and have a platform to voice their opinions and concerns. It creates 
                    a space for people to debate on topics and gives people the chance to be educated on matters that they might not know much or anything in. Aside from that, it 
                    allows people to share their works in whatever form it takes. It allows for creative freedom to create and share things whether you’re trying to build a portfolio 
                    or an online presence with the hopes of potential business opportunities or simply because you want to share your work.</p>
