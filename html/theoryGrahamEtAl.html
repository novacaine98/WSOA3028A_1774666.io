                <p >The study, “Toward a Study of Information Geographies”, is considered by its authors to be the starting point in terms of the research into 
                    information geographies. The study focuses on the ways in which information geographies have their own geographic distributions, namely geographies of access, 
                    representation and participation. </p>

                <p>Information has always been connected to geographical locations, whether it be in terms of where it originated from or where it was sent to 
                    or where it was changed. Information has always emerged from, engaged with and adapted from and to a range of local contexts (Graham et al, 2015). In the current era, 
                    this has not changed. Before jumping into statistics, it is important to first look at the power dynamics regarding the sharing, accessing and participation of information. 
                    Prior to the digital age, information was very heavily geographically encoded. This was due to the nature of accessibility and the power dynamics in terms of the socio-economic 
                    standing of people. Only certain people could have the ability to access information and participate in the creation of it because only those people had access to the technologies 
                    that were used to produce the information. Another hindrance to this was that many people also lacked the required skillsets to produce information and so it was left to the 
                    institutions like universities and associations. This results in very hegemonic representations and hegemonic modes of participation and because knowledge and codified information 
                    are always produced under conditions of power, having control over hegemonic representations result in a very effective way of exerting social, economic and political power 
                    (Graham et al, 2015).</p>

                <p >In the current era, not much has changed. Factors such as mutability, mobility and power relations are still very much present. This is why 
                    ‘immutable mobiles’ is something that is important and relevant. Immutable mobiles is the information that can be transported without significant change to its inherent 
                     characteristics or meaning. As the governments and companies began to participate in the creation of immutable mobiles, information and power became intertwined. </p>

                <p>Immutable mobiles also heavily impact the representation of places. There are layers of meanings and representations that are encoded into 
                    physical places. An example that is given is the Sydney Opera House. It is more than simply the materials it is made from. It is also encoded with the experiences that 
                    people have shared on the internet, with images that people have posted and information that other websites have posted about it. The ways in which information is shared 
                    and expressed can determine what people think about a place and essentially become just as much a part of that place as the materials that were used to build it. They also 
                    essentially shape the way that we find and understand different parts of the world. Places could literally cease to exist to the rest of the world because there is no 
                    information about them. These immutable augmentations do not simply reflect a place, they shape it. </p>

                <p >Ideally, the digital age should be able to shift the power dynamics with regards to immutable augmentations and mobiles and the way that information 
                    is shared and produced. Although not all people everywhere have access there is a significantly greater number of people who have the opportunity to participate in the creation 
                    and production of information now than there was previously. The technology that we have at our disposal now has created an opportunity to equalise the production of information 
                    in terms of who is allowed to or who can do it. With this global connectivity and the idea that everyone everywhere can now participate in this production of information comes doubts. 
                    There are concerns that while there is an opportunity, there are also factors that are being overlooked especially regarding access and accessibility and whether or not, when thinking 
                    in regards to those two factors, the power to control the representation still lies in the hands of those who have far greater social, economic and political power. </p>
                <p>In the study, they decide to break this down by looking into three different categories: </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>1) Geographies of access and enablement</li>
                    <li>2) Geographies of participation</li>
                    <li>3) Geographies of representation</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In terms of access and enablement, it is important to understand that there are certain things that one must have in order to practice digital engagement 
                    and having access to the internet is one of them. In the study, they mapped out the data from the World Bank, with regards to internet users. The data had shown that China possessed 
                    the largest number of people who have access to the internet followed by USA, India and Japan. It showed that Asia contains the largest portion of the internet population at 42%. In 
                    terms of internet penetration, only four of the highest percentages of internet penetration are not found in Europe (Canada, New Zealand, Qatar and South Korea). It would seem that 
                    Latin America and most of Africa sit within the lower brackets with a few exceptions where internet penetration has increased but not by much. This shows that the vast majority of 
                    people on our planet remain without access.</p>

                <p>Another factor to keep in mind is the affordability of internet access. In most places, the cost of having even a years worth of internet access costs far 
                    more than what most people ever make in a year (in Eritrea the cost of a yearly subscription is equivalent to almost 50 years of an average salary). The cost of living alone is already 
                    something that most people struggle with and with minimum wage jobs barely being able to cover most people monthly expenses, it could hardly be expected for everyone to have access to 
                    the internet because access is so expensive.</p>

                <p >When discussing the geographies of participation, there were three different variables that were looked at. Namely domain names, Github users and Wikipedia 
                    edits. These three variables have the highest amount of contributions which is why they were used when looking at participation on the internet. The majority of domains are found in 
                    Europe and North America (78%), highlighting yet again that these two regions dominate internet content production. Asia, despite having such a large percentage of people with access 
                    to the internet, only claim 13% of the domains with Latin America (5%), Oceania (3%) and the Middle East and Africa (2%). The disparity in domains is jarring, to say the least. An important thing to take away from this is that large internet populations do not automatically translate 
                    into a large number of domain registrations or even content production. The results regarding the usage of GitHub are similar to those of the domain with Europe and the USA having the 
                    highest percentage of both users and the number of commits made to GitHub. It also shows that Latin America, Africa and the Middle East having the least number of users and commits. </p>

                <p>Without going into too much detail, Wikipedia, Google searches, OpenStreetMap and Geonames all have similar results: A broad pattern of unevenness throughout 
                    all of these platforms that have resulted in the over-representation of some places (the global north) and the under-representation of others (the global south)</p>

                <p >It does prove in many aspects that although the access to these devices and the internet has increased, there is still a huge disparity in terms of who is 
                    producing the content and by extension, who is producing the representations. It echos what happened in the pre-digital age where the downfall of information that was produced was that 
                    it was hegemonic and that there was an imbalance in who can and cannot participate in the content that is created. It also brings about the worry that if only a select few have the 
                    loudest voice, so to speak, on the internet and in terms of the representations that can be created, are those representation to be trusted? Can you trust someone who lives on an 
                    entirely different continent to accurately represent a place they have never been to or experienced in any way? The results of the research done also highlights the disparity in 
                    resources and economic security of the vast majority of countries. </p>
