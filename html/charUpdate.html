                <p>Hello friends!</p> 
                <p>In these times of revolution and a pandemic and the focus once again on gender based violence, and
                    the light being shone on police brutality as another plague that ravishes the world I feel it is 
                    important to use whatever platform you have, no matter how small, to share information and uplift 
                    the voices of those who are being silenced. 
                </p>
                <p>I beg you to have the hard conversations with people that you know, tackle the hard questions and the 
                    touchy subjects and talk about all of the dark and twisted parts of our society that everyone would
                    rather sweep under the rug. To say silent in times like these is a privilege and to talk over those
                    who are suffering is a sign that you could care less about issues that don't directly impact you. 
                </p>
                <p>Not all of us are free from prejudice and bias and toxic and problematic ways of thinking, and while
                    you might have been raised with these beliefs, it is now your responsibility to listen and learn, to
                    educate yourself and to discover the truth for yourself. You must be willing to acknowledge that there
                    certain prejudices and bias that you have so that you can grow out of and move past that and become a 
                    better person as a result
                </p>
                <p>
                    Understand that no lives matter until black lives matter. Understand what people mean when they say ACAB
                    understand that it is not something that is exclusive to America. Understand the fear that women and children
                    live with. Understand that if a woman tells you something that she has experienced and your immediate response
                    is to downplay their experience and diminish what they've gone through, you are part of the problem. Understand
                    that your time line cannot go 'back to normal' because going back to normal would be spitting in the face of 
                    everyone who has had deal with these broken systems, the people who have lost their lives and the people who are
                    still fighting so change.
                </p>
                <p>I will be focusing a lot of my time now into listening and learning and sharing as much information as I can. Stay
                    safe out there
                </p>
