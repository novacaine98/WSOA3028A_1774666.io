                    <p style="text-align: center;">
                        Hypertext, hyperlinks and the memex are three things that are more closely related than one would think. The term hypertext was originally created by philosopher and sociologist, 
                        Ted Nelson and it was created to mean ‘non-sequential writing’. Hypertext is a non-linear text that is connected by means of links (hyperlinks). It is usually in the form of digital 
                        text that when clicked or tapped on will take the user to another page or section of the page to new information.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">
                        Nelson’s concept of hypertext was greatly influenced by Vannevar Bush’s concept of the memex, which he discussed in an article titled, ‘As We May Think’. I have discussed this in a 
                        previous blog post titled, <a href="theory120220.html">‘The Memex and Vannevar Bush’</a>. In short, the memex was what many referred to as the earliest influence for the concept of hypertext and hyperlinks and the 
                        concept of linking, as it is used on the internet today. The memex made use of microfilm frames to store the information ranging from published articles or personal annotations made 
                        by those who have accessed the information. Bush also wanted the memex to behave in a similar manner to the associative process that the human brain employs in terms of information 
                        and data.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">
                        Hypertext documents can be one of two things: static or dynamic. If the hypertext is static, it can be used to cross-reference collections of data. The types of links that are used 
                        in static hypertext are those that usually replace the current piece of hypertext with the destination of the document. Dynamic hypertext can be used to support complex systems of 
                        linking and cross-referencing.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">
                        There are also four different forms of hypertext, each with different structures. Axial hypertexts have the simplest structure, with straights paths from start to finish which make 
                        it easy for the user to follow. Arborescent hypertext is more complex than axial in the sense that it has a branching structure where a beginning can have multiple different endings 
                        depending on which branches are chosen. Networked hypertexts consist of an interconnected system of nodes with no dominant axis of orientation and unlike the arborescent hypertexts, 
                        there is no designated beginning or endings. The last type of hypertexts is the layered hypertexts that are made up of two layers of linked pages. Each layer is doubly linked 
                        sequentially and a page in the top later in doubly linked with the corresponding page in the bottom later. The top layer has the plain text and the bottom multimedia layer contains 
                        photos, audio and video.</p>
