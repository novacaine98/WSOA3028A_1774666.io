            </div>

            <div class="blog-post" style="max-width: 700px;">
                <time datetime="2020-06-29">29 June 2020</time>
                <p>In their article, Sheena Magenya discusses why, especially now amidst COVID 19, having a more feminist 
                    driven internet is needed. They speak about the importance of uplifting the voices of African women, 
                    LGBTQIA, disabled and anyone who has been pushed to the fringes of society and by creating a feminist 
                    internet, it can provide a place for people to be able to freely express themselves and engage with each 
                    other share content without the worry and fear of the backlash from the current inhabitants of the internet.</p>
                <p>Africa as a continent is one that is incessantly used and viewed as a lab rat for the Global North. They 
                    often seek to diminish the world’s view of the continent to make exploiting them easier. The illegal 
                    testing of drugs on people in Nigeria that resulted the deaths of people, the exploitation of African 
                    countries for their natural resources and the constant slandering of the entire continent in the media as 
                    less developed and overall lacking in many ways compared to the more ‘developed countries.</p>
                <p>Africa is never viewed as the innovators of technology, just the beneficiary. Magenya states that to the rest 
                    of the world, when someone in Africa creates something that is considered to be an astounding innovation, it 
                    is always seen as something that was a product of survival, as a means of battling famine and disease and drought. 
                    People from Africa are never believed to be capable of being innovative and to dabble in the creation of new 
                    technology because it interests and excites them.</p>
                <p>Deeper below this sits the “stories of women, queers, and people with disabilities.” (Magenya, 2020).Everyone’s 
                    response to the lack of socialising during the pandemic and the quarantine was to use the internet, ignoring the 
                    problems and the issues that come from that. With so many people now spending so much more time online now, there 
                    are things that can no longer be ignored. On social media especially, it has been made very clear that being a 
                    woman, LBGTQIA, disabled or any other marginalised identity makes you a prime target for a certain type of 
                    violence specific to the internet, one that is hard to hold people accountable for in the offline world. It 
                    is one thing to call someone out on Twitter and hold them accountable for the things that they say and that 
                    they do but it is another thing to make sure that should they do something harmful in anyway whether over the 
                    internet or if it started on the internet and migrated into the physical, that they can be held accountable and 
                    face repercussions. </p>
                <p>Magenya states that this is why it is important to highlight these voices and create a feminist internet. It is 
                    important to highlight the voices of marginalised communities and especially the further marginalised people within 
                    those communities so that they may have a space to participate in the narratives being discussed, so they may share 
                    and in some way rewrite harmful and ignorant narratives to better the most vulnerable people in a society.</p>
