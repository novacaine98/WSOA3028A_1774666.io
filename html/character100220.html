                    <p style = "text-align: center;">Hi! My name is Prishanti and this is my blog! As this is the first post on my newly created blog, I thought, maybe, that some introductions are in order. So...here goes:
                        My name is Prishanti Moonsamy and I am an artist! Well, a musician but what is music if not art? I have a BA degree majoring in literature, I figured it would help me a lot with writing songs later on in my career. I loved learning about literature and analysing and breaking down and exploring the themes in literary works. 
                        I found it fascinating and I completely fell in love with it and I knew that I wanted to be able to tell stories through music, to communicate beautiful and rich stories that take people on journeys. I don’t have a lot of hobby’s outside of music but I’ve been really interested in taking up something like embroidery or painting.
                        I’ve been leaning more towards painting simply because I like the idea of creating different interpretations of stories. The way that a story is experienced can change almost entirely depending on how you engage with it. I can guarantee you that reading a book and watching a film or TV adaptation envoke very different feelings 
                        and create different impressions on you. If you can’t tell, I am very interested in storytelling...sorry but it’s going to be a frequently featured guest in these posts.</p> 
                    <p style="text-align: center;"> My favourite colours are oranges and browns...though apparently browns are just darker shades of orange so it would be more correct for me to say orange...I won’t because there is a distinction between the two and to me, they mean different things. Brown because it is the colour of my people and the colour of my skin and something 
                        that so deeply ingrained in my culture and my heritage. It’s also something that represents life and birth and existence. All plants, although they come in an entire spectrum of colours, they all spring from the soil, they all gain nutrients and sustenance from the earth, the rich, brown earth. 
                        Orange because it reminds me of all the best things. It reminds me of marigolds and sunlight and warmth. I also just associate orange with home. I always remember going to my grandmother’s house and her giving us slices of orange with a bit of salt sprinkled on top and me thinking that was the most delicious thing in the world.</p> 
                    <p style="text-align: center;"> know introductions are usually a, “Hi my name is so and so and I do this for a living and I am this age!”, and I already said all of that in my bio. I wanted to this to be a little peek into me, as a person, as a creator and as someone who has so much left to experience in life. This blog will be a way for me to share things that 
                        I love and enjoy and the things that I support as well as bits and pieces of my life and my day. I felt like I was beginning to lose touch with myself, who I want to be and who I used to be and I fear that I am going to lose track of who I am right now too. I want this blog to be something for me to create a timeline of my growth as
                        both a person and an artist. I want to be able to come back years from now or even months from now and be in awe of all the things, big and small, that I have been able to do. 
                        Hope you’re ready to come with me on this journey</p>
