                        Hi! My name is Prishanti Moonsamy and I would like to welcome you to my little corner of the world.</p>
                    <p>
                        I am currently working as a singer at a little jazz club in Johannesburg while also trying to build a career as an artist outside of the 
                        club.</p>
                    <p>
                        This space is where I share my thoughts and experiences and where I hope to share little slices of my life as I grow as both a person and 
                        an artist. In time I hope to be able to see myself grow into someone that is happier, healthier, driven and be able to look at myself and 
                        be pround of where I am and where I started.</p>
                    <p>
                        I want to be able to use this platform, while it might not be anything revolutionary, to speak about anything and everything that is 
                        important to me. What I witness everyday being a women in a space that is dominated by men, not even professionally but physically and the 
                        trials and tribulations that come with that.</p>
                    <p>
                        I think that this space can really be something beautiful and inspiring if nothing else, something to look back on and think, "Wow...you've
                        really come a long way, kid".</p>
                    <p>
                        So thanks for hanging out with me on this whackly little journey :)</p>
