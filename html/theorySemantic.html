                        <p>Semantic markup can be defined as the use of a markup language like HTML to convey information about the meaning of the elements 
                            that are used in the documents. This is done through the proper selection of markup elements, and to maintain complete separation 
                            between the markup and the visual presentation of the elements contained within the document. Semantic markup can also be describes 
                            as HTML that introduces meaning to a web page as opposed to simply presenting it</p>
                        <p>While good use of styling can visually make up for poorly implemented markup, it will still be of no value to a computerised 
                                visitor like a search engine crawler, assistive technologies, or translation tools. The semantic use of HTML elements is considered
                                to be required if you want your website to be accessible to all visitors, to attract and have visitors from around the world to 
                                your website as well as to interface effectively with other web services.</p>
                        <p>Semantic markup is about making web content that is readable to both humans and computers. When both parties can read as well the other, 
                            the web content becomes a great deal more accessible. This is because computers will be able to analyse the content, index and deliver it.</p>
                        <p>The benefits of writing HTML using semantic markup stems from communication or the desire to communicate. Adding semantic tags to your 
                            document provides additional information about that document, aiding in more effective communication</p>
