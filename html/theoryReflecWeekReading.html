            </div>

            <div class="blog-post" style="max-width: 700px;">
                <time datetime="2020-06-27">26 June 2020</time>
                <p>The paper, Digital inequalities and why they matter, seeks to point out and shed light on the 
                    consequences of the widening digital inequalities that people face and how these inequalities 
                    impact and affect quality of life and how they permeate  all levels of society.</p>
                <p>Throughout the paper, a common theme runs clear, that digital inequalities heighten these pre-existing 
                    inequalities that have been prevalent in societies for centuries. If nothing, these digital inequalities 
                    add another layer of complexity to those that already exist.</p>
                <p>There are said to be three types of digital divide, namely the gender divide, the social divide and the 
                    universal access divide (Steele, 2019). In the Robinson et al paper, they speak about these three 
                    factors in relation to the digital divide in a way that showcases how digital inequalities and the 
                    digital divide further impact other factors. Digital inequalities are not only influenced by long-standing 
                    forms of inequality but also influence them and further perpetuate and entrench those on the receiving end. 
                    People who suffer as a result of digital inequalities and the huge disparities in terms of the digital 
                    divide, miss opportunities in terms of their education and their career and find themselves underrepresented 
                    as a community when data is collected based on digital footprints. Their healthcare treatments and 
                    their engagement in politics is also limited because of these disparities.</p>
                <p>In terms of gender, women are at a disadvantage with regards to the space that they can take up and 
                    they ways that they engage with the internet. According to Steele, men in low-income countries are 
                    90% more likely to own a mobile phone than a woman. Without even broaching the subject of engaging 
                    on the internet, a vast majority of women in low-income countries are without a means to access it. 
                    Women have, compared to men, a lower frequency of use, lower intensity of use, narrower range of 
                    online activities and a lower likelihood of reporting strong internet skills (Robinson et al, 2015). 
                    This prevents women from creating and developing social capital, finding employment opportunities as 
                    well as education opportunities.</p>
                <p>Women are also said to downplay and underestimate their online skills and abilities when compared to men. 
                    This creates a gendered gap in self-perceptions. Women are said to do this even if their skills are equal 
                    or greater to that of a man. In the field of IT, it is very much a male dominated space and it is not 
                    limited to work spaces either. These disparities in women joining fields around IT and men who are 
                    also part of those fields is said to continue because at the very core of the issue, for a lot of 
                    women, the most basic requirement needed to engage with this space is not being met. That coupled 
                    with the toxic and aggressive manner in which women are treated in online spaces acts as an active 
                    discouragement from joining or engaging in the field. Women downplay their skills and abilities as 
                    a means of survival for the most part and in other times, it is a by-product of being exposed to 
                    these male dominated spaces.</p>
                <p>Race and ethnicity also play roles in digital inequalities and digital inequalities play a role in 
                    the inequalities experienced by the BIPOC community. Robinson et al explains how it is people of 
                    racial and ethnic groups who would benefit the most from the internet in terms of building good 
                    social capital and finding new ways of accessing opportunities regarding work and education. 
                    However, in both developed and developing nations, if the majority of the BIPOC people are not 
                    able to access these tools to help improve their lives how else can they? A lack of access to the 
                    internet and to devices that help them access it, contributes to the inequalities experienced by 
                    people in these communities. It is also a case of these communities having their voices and their 
                    content on the internet silenced, for example on the app TikTok. BIPOC creators are constantly 
                    having their accounts shadow banned and their videos deleted especially when speaking about important 
                    issues that their communities face. These are usually explained to the creators as their content 
                    was violating community guide lines but this was not the case. <a href="https://www.pride.com/news/2020/6/03/tiktok-issues-formal-apology-black-creators-after-censorship-claims">See here for an article</a> regarding 
                    the matter. </p>
                <p>Race and ethnicity also play a part when speaking about the digital divide between the Global North 
                    and the Global South. The Global North contributes to the bulk of the content produced on the 
                    internet as well as the bulk of interactions that take place on the internet. The Global South, 
                    however, struggles with having the internet be something that all people can access in a way that 
                    will not cost them everything they have and then some as well as having access to the devices 
                    required to use the internet, let alone contribute to the content creation.</p>
                <p>These are just a few of the branches of society that are impacted by digital inequalities. Issues 
                    like this are so deeply interwoven in the systems and structures of societies and the digital 
                    inequalities that have made themselves present can only be fixed when the large systems are 
                    reworked so that they benefit all people and not select few.</p>
