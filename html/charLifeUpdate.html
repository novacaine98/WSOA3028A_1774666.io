                    Hi! Prishanti here and today…today I am not doing so great. So I haven’t been able to really post much on here or at least as much as I would like. Reason being this pandemic has really taken me for a ride that I, most definitely, did not ask for. 
                    <p style="text-align: center;">Due to the restrictions placed on the entire country for the lockdown period and the ban on the selling of alcohol, the club had to close its doors for, what we thought would be, a while. Initially, my boss had assured 
                        us that we would still be paid and that the club would be able to survive this. </p> 
                    <p style="text-align: center;">I guess with signs that the whole world was crumbling, I wanted nothing more than to believe that the club would weather this storm and in no time at all we would be back at work and I would be able to complain about 
                        nightmare traffic or tell you all funny stories about my nights at the club. That didn’t happen. I’ll spare you the grim details and the fighting and the arguing and trying and trying and trying to get aid from the government (not that they 
                        would help to fund a club but a small business is a small business and we were hoping). We hoped some of our wealthier patrons might be able to help but they quickly turned their backs on us. In the midst of being told that the place where I 
                        spend most of my time, where I had made the bulk of my friends and the place where my dreams and goals actually felt tangible, I had to hear about the same thing happening to others. </p> 
                    <p style="text-align: center;">How small business were being forced to shut down because they couldn’t afford to pay rent or because they weren’t able to get help, how people were going unpaid or how those who earn the least in big companies were 
                        the ones having their pay cut rather than going for those who have more than enough wealth to share. </p> 
                    <p style="text-align: center;">My father phoned my and these days, my heart sinks every time one of my parents phone. Luckily my dad and my mom haven’t been too badly impacted the only thing they don’t like is that none of their kids can come visit…lol</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">That’s it from me, friends. I hope you’re all staying safe and well and that you are protecting yourself, your loved ones and your energy. I’ll be sure to check in soon </p>
