                <p>For the most part, the reasons behind why I decided to create Prishanti as my character for these assignments is because I want her to represent what I find to be lacking in media as a whole. The lack of representation of 
                    Indian men and women in any kind of media and a positive and constructive type of representation is severely lacking. I wanted to be able to communicate the kinds of barriers and struggles that an Indian person can be up against in life. From career 
                    expectations from families, the representation and the stigmas that surround certain topics among the Indian community especially around mental health. In my opinion, in a lot of the media that we consume daily, Indian people are rarely featured and 
                    more so when we are featured it is hardly in a positive light. </p>
                <p>Prishanti works as a vessel for what I hope can be interpreted as a real and positive depiction of an Indian woman living in Johannesburg and trying to follow her passions and who does battle with her mental health and does 
                    have to deal with the roadblocks that come with trying to pursue one’s passion. For me, it is important to have these kinds of representations or at least have them be attempted. </p>
                <p> Although she works as a singer in a jazz styled club, jazz music is not the only type of music that she wants to explore. To her, the genre and style of music is not the star of the songs she wants to write. She wants genre 
                    and style to facilitate and support the narrative of the story she wants to communicate. Having her be someone who wants to pursue a career in the arts was also important and it was the first thing that felt as though it had to be included in her character. 
                    Having her pursue a career in the arts was something that felt important because of the stigma that hangs around the topic, especially among Indian communities. It was a topic that felt necessary to bring especially if the intention with Prishanti’s character 
                    is to create someone who has to deal with issues like this, where choices have to be made in terms of who do you decide to live for? For many people, they choose to live for others, they want to make their parents proud or at least not disappoint them and so 
                    they choose to live for others. Speaking from personal experience, what my parents thought and what they told me they wanted me to get out of life influenced the decisions that I made when I was applying for university. It is important to speak about the 
                    crushing weight of expectations and the negative effects on one’s mental health that develop when dealing with trying to do what you want but also understand that that might not be what your family wants from you.  Often, it is easy to stand on the outside 
                    and tell someone that they should just live for themselves without understanding the dynamics that exist within these relationships. </p>
