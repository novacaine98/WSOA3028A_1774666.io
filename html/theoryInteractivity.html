                    The concept of interactivity has been known to be something that is very tricky to explain. Trying to determine what makes something interactive is not simple by any means. 
                    There are too many possible parameters to be considered and too many loopholes those are found and all in all the term is, as Lev Manovich said, too broad to be useful and 
                    by extension, too broad to be defined. Many theorists have tried to create requirements for what might make something interactive but those definitions on their own are 
                    still not enough to properly express and explain why or how something is interactive. </p>
                <p>
                    Aaron Smuts gave a list of requirements for what makes something interactive. He stated that based on the existing definitions and theories at the time, something could be 
                    said to be interactive if it is (1) responsive, (2) does not completely control, (3) is not completely controlled and (4) does not respond in a completely random fashion. 
                    Smuts tries to encompass as many facets of what is understood about interactivity but there are some things that slip through the cracks. It brings up the possibility that 
                    everything could be interactive depending on the context. It also brings to light the fact that output should always be relational to the input.</p>
                <p >
                    Espen Aarseth, in his work, Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature, replaces the word ‘interactive’ with ‘ergodic’. He then defines ergodic as something that requires 
                    nontrivial effort to allow a reader to traverse the text. The use of the word ergodic in place of the word interactivity helps to explain what it meant by interactivity and 
                    makes it easier to form a distinction between what might be interactive.</p>
                <p >
                    A possible working definition is that something is interactive if it is responsive, it does not respond in a completely random fashion but the response is relational to the 
                    input that is given, requires nontrivial effort and can, in some way, modify the shape of the text itself</p>
