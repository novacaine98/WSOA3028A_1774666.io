                <p>A URL can be define as being one of the key concepts of the Web. It is a 
                    mechanism that browsers use to retrieve published resources or content 
                    on the web.</p> 
                <p>URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. In essence, it is an address of 
                    a unique resource on the Web. It is left to the owner of the web server 
                    that hosts the resource and the URL for it, to manage and maintain them. </p>
                <p>A URL is comprised of different parts, some of which are crucial to the 
                    functioning of the URL and other’s which are optional to include. These 
                    parts include the protocol, the domain name, the port, the path to the 
                    file, the parameters and the anchor. </p>
                <p>The protocol is a set method for exchanging or transferring data around a 
                    computer network. A domain name is what indicates what web server is being 
                    requested. The port is a technical “gate” or doorway that is used to access 
                    resources on the web server. The path to the file indicates where the resource 
                    is on the web server, like directions. An anchor works as an anchor to another 
                    part of the resource itself, acting as something of a bookmark within the 
                    resource. It then provides directions to the browser to show it to the content 
                    at that bookmarked location. </p>
                <p>URLs are meant to make navigating the Web and accessing resources easier. The 
                    way in which a web browser finds web pages is by using an IP (Internet Protocol) 
                    which is represented as a string of numbers. URLs were then created so that people 
                    would not have to enter long strings of numbers in order to access something on the web. </p>
                <p>Not every site has a static or a constant IP, some changing regularly. This would 
                    make it very difficult for anyone to go directly to the site they want to visit.</p>
