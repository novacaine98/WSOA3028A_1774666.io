                <h4> Character Blog: Meet Prishanti Moonsamy! </h4>
                <p>
                    Prishanti is considered by many to be the black sheep of her family. She chose passion over practicallity, not wanting to wake up everyday hating 
                    where she worked and worse yet, hating what she did and so decided to pursure a career in the arts, namely music. With the blessing of her family, 
                    she left home after graduating from university and got herself a job as a jazz singer in a jazz club in Sandton, Johannesburg. She is forced into
                    a persona of someone who is so unlike her, she fears that one day she'll forget herself and will forget what her passion is at its core. She deals 
                    with the fear of failure and grapples with tough decisions like if she leaves the club will she be able to work on her career and keep a roof over 
                    her head and keep the lights on. She struggles with being very much in a man's industry and though they might not be competeing with her as an artist,
                    they crowd her phsyical space and seem to control all avenues of the possible career she wants to be in. Through the blog posts, she hopes to create
                    a bigger discourse around work spaces for brown woman in different spaces and the fears and dangers she and others experience, but also share what makes
                    her happy and inspired.

                <h4> Theory Blog: The Memex </h4>
                <p>
                    From what I could understand in the reading and what I could find when I did some surface level research, was that the memex that Bush was talking
                    about had to do with links. Like the links we can create and interact with on the internet. It sounded like a really early stage version of a possible
                    internet or a system that fucntioned in a similar manner to the internet. Linking information from a vast array of knowledge, spanning over hundreds 
                    of topics and fields and interests. The way that Bush planned to implement it was definitely different from how the internet was implemented and how it
                    works now but that was more because of the time in which Bush wrote that paper and also the technology that was availble the time. The similarites are 
                    quite interesting to see or witness how someone who lived during a very different time, linking and creating these ideas that, for the most part, came into
                    fruition years later.

                <h4> Theory Blog: The Promise and Perils of User Generated Content </h4>
                <p> 
                    It would seem, now more than ever, that user generated content lies at the heart of the internet. It exists in almost every possible corner of 
                    the internet. It lies in the comment and review sections, in forums and blogs, in art, in curated feeds and so on. It opened the door for 
                    providing everyone with access to the internet, a means to communicate and share and build communities and engage with content. In its early 
                    days it a very idealistic concept. The reality of open forums and communication channels where anything and everything could be posted and 
                    where community guidines could be skirted and loopholes could be found to the extent where no one is held accountable. Malicious content and 
                    hate speech are allowed to roam freely on the internet without anyone taking responsibility for what they said and how they act, hiding behind 
                    claims of "free speech" to justify or excuse what they've done.<br>
                    User generated contetnt, or at least a majority of the content that speaks to it, is targeted towards the benefits and risks faced in the 
                    commercial  space. They speak about how user generated content helps with sales and marketing and how having spaces where user generated 
                    content can be created like blogs, social media platforms and so on, it could help with the image of the brand and the business and can help 
                    build a reputation among internet users (although this is like a double edged sword in the sense that one mistake in a space as large as the 
                    internet, where information spreads like wildfire could cost you everything in an instant).<br>
                    User generated content with all the potential good that it can do for the individual as well as for companies and businesses, it can also open
                    the door for possible content abuse. For the most part, a large part of the types of abuse that could arise are fraud related. The stealing of
                    identies, phishing, content theft and plagarism.<br>
                    While there does seem like there's always more negative than positives to speak about, user generated content does have its moments. Apart from 
                    communicating online with others, it also provides a space for people to share news and to learn about what is going on in the world around 
                    them. It creates opportunities of citizen journalism and offers up a space for people to recieve information and then be able to voice their
                    opinions and concerns, for them to debate and be educated on matters that they might not be too clued up on. Aside from that, it allows people 
                    to share their works in whatever form it takes. It allows for the creative freedom to create and share things whether you're trying to build a 
                    protfolio or an online presence with the hopes of potentital business opportunities or purely becuase you want to share.<br>

                <h4> Character Blog </h4>
                <p>
                    that is exactly what it's beginning to feel like. At first it was a series of small mishaps that I was willing to write off as me being clumsy
                    or just hitting my bi-weekly rough patch but then things started escalating and I couldn't help but feeling like there was a larger conspiracy 
                    taking place.<br>
                    A regular at the club, a man not that much older than my father who always drinks beyond his limits, got particularly handsy with not just me but 
                    also with the wait staff...I'd rather not get into the details but thankfully (I can't believe I'm saying this) it didn't escalate to anything 
                    beyond a hand on the waist pass by or a pat on the bum or into something violent. Trying to lay a complaint with management is always an uphill 
                    battle and always feels more like talking to a brick wall. They always lay down the same story. The customers are the only thing keeping this 
                    place from sinking six feet under. They're essential the club's survival. They're very clearly saying that achieving ultimate customer satisfaction 
                    is always the top priority even if it is at the expense of your staffs bodies. <br>
                    I had to stand there and smile, trying to keep my voice level and carry on with the performance...because as much as I would much rather burn this 
                    club to the ground, I am utterly dependent on it. I could do some crummy office job but the likelihood of me experiencing the same bullshit there is 
                    the same as it is here. The only difference is corporate bureaucracy...I guess. <br>
                    Days like this makes me wish I listened to my parents when they told me to work towards a sensible career, something that I could do for the rest of 
                    my life with certainty. I'm tired of the gross old men and the gross young men who think their lingering stares and wondering hands are the proper
                    way to treat anyone. I'm tired of the constant fear hanging over my head...the daunting 'what if?'. What if that one patron decides someone owes him 
                    something because they were nice to him, what if they try something because they think they can or because no one will miss us.
                    It's exhausting. But that's life...isn't it? <br>

                <h4> Theory: Accessibility </h4>
                <p>
                    Accessibility refers to the idea that software and most things in life should be designed to be useable and made to be as convinient as possible for 
                    people with disabilities. It is important to consider this when creating software or anything that is expected to be used in society because to not 
                    people who have disabilities or are in any way disadvantaged from the 'majority' creates a space where these people are excluded from being able to 
                    the internet. <br>
                    Apart from it being beneficial for all users of the internet, it also helps with Search Engine Optimisation because search engines crawl through websites 
                    in the same ways screen readers do.<br>
                    Accessibility is important because the internet makes up such a large portion of our lives. From education to recreation to government. It is important to
                    create and provde equal access and opportunity for people to navigate and engage with content on the internet. There are a few ways to make the web accessible.
                    The use of Alt-tags. This is an alternative html attribute that is used to describe an image. It allows the designer to create a helpful description for screen 
                    readers (could be used to facilitate people who blind).<br>
                    Keyboard navigation. Don't mess around with navigation buttons because it could cause confusion or could hinder the use of other accessibility tools like screen
                    readers.<br>
                    Use the ARIA tag: ARIA is a set of html attributes that define ways to make web content and applications more accessibile to people with disabilities. <br>
